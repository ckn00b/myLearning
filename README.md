# myLearning
Where I keep all my trials and labs!

On my home computer, I use the command line and Visual Studio Code as much as possible to learn computer programming and further develop my skills. I enjoy Linux but own a Windows laptop, so I run Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 with Ubuntu to enjoy both operating systems when I want or need them. With the Internet at my fingertips, I use various sources to find learning material and make subdirectories in this repository for each lab or trial. This allows me to further quantify my learning by keeping track of it all with Git and simultaneously giving me archival access to tools and lessons I've come across.

If you happen to come across this repo and have questions about what I'm doing or where I'm finding my resources, please ask! I'm hoping to help others and also network while I learn!

Thanks for reading!
